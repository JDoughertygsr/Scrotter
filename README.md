-----------------

## Development & Contribution

### Getting started

- Clone Scrotter if you haven't already.
- Navigate to the "android" branch.
- Open the .m4a (android solution) file in Basic4Android, [located here](http://www.basic4ppc.com/).

### Setting up a test environment

- Follow Basic4Android's [tutorial](http://www.basic4ppc.com/android/downloads.html), using the Local Compilation / Full Version guidelines. Scrotter is tested under an Android 4.0.3 (API15) VM.

### Compiling

- Feel free to compile locally. The standard Build > Build Solution option in Visual Studio 2012 is used for official builds.
- Builds are NOT released for the rolling source - builds will only be compiled and published for each version. The source is extremely experimental, and only those that know how to compile should test it.

### Contributing

- Fork the project and make pull requests to the m4a file.

### Issues & Suggestions

- If you have suggestions or issue reports, please post them in the [issues](https://github.com/Yttrium-tYcLief/Scrotter/issues) section, with the "[Android]" prefix.
- If you wish to request a new device, please see [this page](https://github.com/Yttrium-tYcLief/Scrotter/wiki/Requesting-a-New-Device) on doing so.
